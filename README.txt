This method of visualization uses Cesium.JS, a JavaScript library for 3D visualization.

Kindly run the html file in the browser to see the visualization. 

There is another method of visualization using CesiumJS which is done using WebPacks. That method is more robust but is heavy to share. 

Currently, I am working on connecting the Geoserver WMS layer directly to the Cesium Plaform.
